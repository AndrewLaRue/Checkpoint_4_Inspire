Stretch Goals

[--]   Allow the user to set their name and have it save to localStorage

[--]   Change the message from Good Morning to Good Afternoon, Evening as appropriate

[--]   Allow the user to toggle the clock from, 12hr to 24hr

[--]   Include an Icon to show what the weather is sunny/cloudy/rainy hint look at the weather data

[-X-]   Add a button to cycle to next quote/picture

[--]   Add a settings so user can change to a new 'theme' (font, background colors, etc.)

[--]   Clicking the weather should let the user toggle between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin

[--]   If you think through some of the actions being performed you might find a way to optimize the list by only updating the one todo that changes at a time

[--]   Every time you update a todo you shouldn't have to re-get the entire list you already know what changed about the one todo
